  <h1>Blackjackhack: Use Playing Cards for Storygame Combat</h1>

  <p>In blackjackhack, characters are represented with a hand of playing cards, and each hand is built to a total of <strong>21</strong> points.</p>

  <h2>Game Setup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hand Total:</strong> Each hand’s card values add up to 21.</li>
    <li><strong>Card Values:</strong> Cards have numeric values (e.g., 2–10).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conflict Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Both players simultaneously play a card face-down from their hands to use as an attack. Then they all reveal played cards.</li>
    <li>Each player then opponent must respond by discarding cards whose <strong>combined value exceeds</strong> the value of the card used to attack them.</li>
    <li>Attack bonus effects trigger only if the defender is forced to combine <strong>more than one</strong> card.</li>
    <li>Defense bonus effects trigger only if the defender is used <strong>exactly one</strong> card.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Suit Effects</h2>
  <p>Each suit in the game provides a unique effect. Attack effects only come into play when the defender uses multiple cards to meet the defense requirement. Defense effectrs only come into play when the defender uses a single card for defense.</p>

  <h3>Clubs – Power, Strength</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Effect:</strong> When attacking with a Clubs card, if the defender is forced to use multiple cards to defend, after a successful defense they must discard one extra card.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Spades – Feints, Dexterity</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Effect:</strong> When attacking with a Spades card, the attacker may choose a suit. If the defender uses multiple cards in their defense, they cannot use that chosen suit on their next attack.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Hearts – Resistance, Build</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Effect:</strong> When defending with a sole Hearts card, that card gains a +1 bonus to its value.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Diamonds – Control, Cool</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Effect:</strong> When defending with a sole Diamonds card, after a successful defense, the attacker discards a card.</li>
  </ul>
